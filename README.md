In this project I used Heart Attack dataset.
Performed data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Implemented a logistic regression model from scratch without using any pre-built libraries for the model itself. Only NumPy or Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Trained logistic regression model on the training data.
Evaluateed the model's performance on the testing data using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
